This application simulates the workflow of a customer creating credit applications, which are then approved or rejected.

- A customer must be created before a credit application can be created. After a customer is created, any number of credit applications can be created that are connected to said customer.
  
- These credit applications might be rejected upon creation based on certain parameters provided to them upon their creation. If they are not rejected, they will be pending.

- Pending credit applications can then be approved or rejected manually.
